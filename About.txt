The SautiDB dataset collection project (https://sautidb.web.app/) is an ongoing effort to collect datasets of various Nigerian accents. 

The filename has the form nativeLanguage_fluentLanguage_speakerID_gender_sentenceID.wav where
nativeLanguage: Language spoken by the speaker's tribe. Native (mother) language of the speaker
fluentLanguage: Language that the speaker thinks best describe their accents
speakerID: ID assigned to speakers. Kindly note that it's possible that one speaker maps multiple IDs. 
This is because the speakers are not required to login to the system, we simply cache their browser session to recognize their subsequent uploads
gender: Gender of the speaker. Kindly note that we did not collect this information from the speakers, we hand-labelled this.
sentenceID: The sentence ID for the read sentences. We used the CMU Arctic sentences and can be found on http://www.festvox.org/cmu_arctic/cmuarctic.data
