The SautiDB dataset collection project (https://sautidb.web.app/) is an ongoing effort to collect dataset of various Nigerian accents. 

The filename has the form nativeLanguage_fluentLanguage_speakerID_gender_sentenceID.wav where
nativeLanguage: Language spoken by the speaker's tribe. Native (mother) language of the speaker
fluentLanguage: Language that the speaker thinks best describe their accents
speakerID: ID assigned to speakers. Kindly note that it's possible that one speaker maps multiple IDs. 
This is because the speakers are not required to login to the system, we simply cache their browser session to recognize their subsequent uploads
gender: Gender of the speaker. Kindly note that we did not collect this information from the speakers, we hand-labelled this.
sentenceID: The sentence ID for the read sentences. We used the CMU Arctic sentences and can be found on http://www.festvox.org/cmu_arctic/cmuarctic.data

Version 1.1
============================
This version has two updates:

1. In version 1.0, the naming convention for each language was to space each language with an underscore and uppercased, e.g., "Efik Ibibio" -> "EFIK_IBIBIO". 
In hindsight, this was not ideal, as the filename was also joined with an underscore: 'nativeLanguage_fluentLanguage_speakerID_gender_sentenceID.wav'. 
This can cause errors for users who are not aware of it. For example, consider the filename 'EFIK_IBIBIO_EFIK_IBIBIO_0014_M_A0138.wav'. 
A user who splits the filename by an underscore could unknowingly have 'nativeLanguage= EFIK' and 'fluentLanguage=IBIBIO', which would result in an error in their analysis. 
This version fixes that error. We have changed "EFIK_IBIBIO" -> "EFIKIBIBIO". i.e. the file name, which was previously 'EFIKIBIBIO_EFIKIBIBIO_0014_M_A0138.wav', has now been changed to 'EFIKIBIBIO_EFIKIBIBIO_0014_M_A0138.wav'. 
This change applies only to languages that contain spaces. The rest of the filenames therefore remain unchanged, i.e. 'EDO_YORUBA_0053_M_B0389.wav' is still 'EDO_YORUBA_0053_M_B0389.wav'.

2. We include an audio_metadata.csv file containing 'filename', 'nativeLanguage', 'fluentLanguage', 'speakerID', 'gender', 'sentenceID' and 'sentence', 'duration'. 
We hope this will make it easier for users to use our dataset for their work. The duration was calculated using the function 'librosa.get_duration()'.
