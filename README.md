# Sautidb-Naija Corpus
This repository contains the pre-processing scripts for the SautiDB-Naija corpus, an accented speech corpus curated by [TheSautiProject](sautiproject.com) team, intended for accent translation tasks.

# Background
The SautiDB dataset collection project is an ongoing effort to collect datasets of various Nigerian accents. The dataset was collected in an uncontrolled manner, users who visit our webapp can record their voice and contribute to the dataset. The webapp uses the audio webapi to collect voice samples. We hope this dataset will be useful to people interested in developing voice technology in Nigeria. We will continuously collect more datasets and publish updated versions as we have them. This work grew out of our project [Improving Online Experience using Accent Transfer](https://www.k4all.org/project/accent-transfer/).
